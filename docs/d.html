<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p><hr>

<p>There are a few issues which have been reported as bugs in the past or
discovered by the author, but which either are not consistently
reproduceable or are a consequence of the way Services works and not easily
avoidable.  These issues are listed below.</p>

<h3>Nickname and NickServ issues</h3>

<p><ul><li>When setting NickServ options for other users as a Services
administrator, NickServ will incorrectly respond with "Your (option name)
has been changed" or similar messages, as though the Services admin's
nickname settings had been changed.  (The target nickname's settings are
in fact correctly modified, while the admin's settings are left alone.)

<p><li>If you disable one or more of the <tt>nickserv/access</tt>,
<tt>nickserv/autojoin</tt>, <tt>memoserv/main</tt>, and
<tt>memoserv/ignore modules</tt>, delete a nickgroup, create a new
nickgroup that has the same ID, and re-enable the module(s), the new
nickgroup will keep any data from those module(s) that belonged to the old
nickgroup.  Since nickgroup IDs are assigned randomly, this should be a
rare occurrence.

</ul>

<h3>Channel and ChanServ issues</h3>

<p><ul><li>Services appears to incorrectly detect "mode bouncing" (<i>i.e.,</i>
the IRC server reversing Services' mode changes) in some cases.  When this
occurs, commands like <tt>KICK</tt> and <tt>TOPIC</tt> as well as auto-ops
and mode locking will no longer work on that channel.  If this problem
occurs, appropriate messages will be written to the log file; the problem
can be worked around by either clearing the channel (removing all users
from the channel) or restarting Services.  Adding the
<a href="a.html#NoBouncyModes"><tt>NoBouncyModes</tt></a> directive in
<tt>ircservices.conf</tt> will prevent this problem from occurring, but
will cause mode floods if you have an incorrectly configured server on your
network.

<p><li>If a user without auto-op privileges enters a registered, empty
channel and sends a MODE command to change the channel modes before
Services removes the user's channel operator privileges, the changed modes
will remain in effect on the channel.  On some IRC servers, such as
InspIRCd and ircd-ratbox, this can be avoided by setting the
<a href="a.html#protocol/(insert_protocol_name_here).CSSetChannelTime"><tt>CSSetChannelTime</tt></a>
option in <tt>modules.conf</tt>.

<p><li>When kicking users from forbidden channels (or in other cases when a
user tries to join an empty channel and is kicked), Services will generate
debug log messages about "<tt>MODE +b for unknown channel</tt>".  These are
a side effect of the order in which Services processes the operations
involved in the kickban; they are harmless and can be safely ignored.  The
same or similar messages can also appear during a netburst when modes are
sent for a channel after all the users in the channel have been kicked, or
when joins and modes are sent for a user who gets autokilled.

<p><li>If you try to enter an empty channel and get kicked and banned by
ChanServ, you cannot get in with <tt>UNBAN</tt> or <tt>INVITE</tt> even if
you would normally have privileges to do so because ChanServ reports that
the channel does not exist.  This is because ChanServ does not keep track
of channels that it is currently residing in after a kickban in the same
way that it does for ordinary users.

<p><li>When using protocols that support ban exceptions, users can get
around the "ban" part of a kickban in an empty channel by sending a ban
exception quickly enough that the server processes it before Services is
able to kick the user, allowing the user to repeatedly rejoin the channel
(and get immediately kicked again).  This is a side effect of Services not
tracking empty channels in which ChanServ is residing, but if your IRC
server's flood protection is set up properly, this will not be a problem in
practice (there are many ways for users to generate more network traffic
than a join/part loop).

<p><li>There appear to be some cases in which channel modes (<tt>+k</tt>
and <tt>+o</tt> have been reported) are set twice in succession for the
same channel.  This naturally has no effect on the channel itself, but some
users have reported it as annoying.  Services attempts to detect and
correct this, but it may still occur in some cases.

</ul>

<h3>Administration and other issues</h3>

<p><ul><li>If you are not using encrypted passwords, then all passwords will
be truncated to be at most 32 characters (or <tt>PASSMAX</tt> characters,
if you change the value of <tt>PASSMAX</tt> in the <tt>defs.h</tt> source
file) long.  As a result, any password with the same initial sequence of
characters will be treated as a match, even if it is not exactly the same
password initially set.

<p><li>When setting another nickname's password or a channel's password as
a Services administrator, NickServ (or ChanServ) will send out the
"<tt><i>ADMIN</i> used SET PASSWORD as Services admin for <i>TARGET</i></tt>"
global message even if the password change is rejected due to length or
similarity with the target nickname or channel name.  This is difficult to
fix cleanly in the current code structure (which is one reason the message
was written as "used SET PASSWORD" instead of "changed password").  Since
this is expected to be a rare occurrence, clarity of code was given
preference over adding special-case processing for this case.  Note that
setting the
<a href="a.html#NoAdminPasswordCheck"><tt>NoAdminPasswordCheck</tt></a>
option in <tt>ircservices.conf</tt> will disable all password checks for
Services administrators, thus avoiding this problem.

<p><li>When using the Bahamut protocol, Services will log warnings about
missing IP addresses each time an opermasked client connects to the network
or rejoins after a netsplit.  This is unavoidable on Services' part, since
the Bahamut protocol does not seem to provide a way to differentiate between
opermasked clients and servers which do not send IP addresses at all.

<p><li>It has been reported that using the OperServ <tt>JUPE</tt> command
on a Bahamut-based network for a server two or more hops away from the
Services uplink server can cause Services to be dropped from the network.

<p><li>If you compile on a Macintosh (OSX) system using dynamic modules,
the <tt>encryption/unix-crypt</tt> module may fail to load.  If this
happens, compile using static modules instead (<tt>./configure
-use-static-modules</tt>).

</ul>
