<h3 class="subsection-title" id="s1">11-1. Design issues</h3>

<ul>

<li class="spaced">Services currently operates under the assumption that
enough memory will be available for its needs, and simply aborts the
program in most cases if a memory allocation fails (the <tt>smalloc()</tt>
function).  On modern systems this should be true most of the time anyway,
but a better design would eliminate <tt>smalloc()</tt> and friends, and
instead degrade gracefully when out of resources (for example, returning an
"internal error" or "out of resources" message to a pseudoclient command).</li>

<li class="spaced">Services ignores the possibility of truncation when
using the <tt>snprintf()</tt> and <tt>vsnprintf()</tt> functions.  In most
cases, such truncation would only result in the user seeing a truncated
response string, and I have (at least in recent development) made an effort
to check for overflow in security-related situations before calling
<tt>snprintf()</tt>, but I cannot rule out the possibility that some
security issues related to string truncation exist.  The code should be
rewritten to (1) use an <tt>snprintf()</tt> that follows the POSIX
standard of returning the number of bytes that would be written given an
infinite buffer and (2) check the return value for overflow where
pertinent.</li>

<li class="spaced">As also mentioned in <a href="10.html#s5">section
10-5</a>, the module callback implementation relies on the very flaky
assumption that any type can be passed through a <tt>void&nbsp;*</tt> and
come out unscathed on the other side, regardless of the parameter types
used by the called function.  This happens to work on the Intel x86
architecture because everything is 32 bits, and on the AMD x86-64
architecture because the first five parameters (the maximum supported for
callbacks in the current implementation) are passed in registers rather
than on the stack, but there is no guarantee that this will also work on
future (or other existing) architectures.  The implementation also assumes
that a function can be passed more parameters than it actually accepts
without any harm.  One possible alternative is to use variadic argument
lists, but this would require changing all callback functions to take a
<tt>va_list</tt> argument and retrieve the arguments manually; due to the
amount of work this would take, the current implementation has been left
alone for this release, and a redesign is left for future work.</li>

<li class="spaced">Services defines its own types for integers of specific
sizes: <tt>int8</tt>, <tt>uint32</tt>, and the like.  The standard header
file <tt>stdint.h</tt> declares similar types, using names like
<tt>int8_t</tt> and <tt>uint32_t</tt>; however, these are not used because
this header file did not exist (or was not standardized, at least) during
the early stages of Services' development, when the need for sized integer
types arose.  Changing the code to use the standard types would remove the
need to define those types in the <tt>configure</tt> script.</li>

<li class="spaced">It has been suggested from time to time that Services
use a full-fledged database management system such as MySQL for database
storage, to allow easy access to the data by other programs such as CGI
scripts on a web server.  In fact, the major services programs I am aware
of which are currently (October 2007) under development seem to be taking
this route.  However, Services has been designed from the start with the
assumption that its data will never be modified by any outside process, and
in fact, even the change from periodic expiration to expiration on access
made during 5.0 alpha development caused several dangling-pointer bugs to
surface.  Attempting to use external databases that could be modified by
other programs within the current Services framework would at best cause
such modified data to be overwritten when Services saved its databases, and
at worst cause Services to crash when it tried to access data that had been
modified without its knowledge.  That said, this design decision enforces a
single-threaded execution model for the entire program, and for that reason
alone is a good target for redesign.  (With respect to read-only access to
Services data, XML-based data export was added in version 5.0.)</li>

<li class="spaced">In relation to the above, XML has also been suggested as
a native database format.  I have been reluctant to do this, both from the
practical point of view that writing the databases in a textual format
takes considerably longer than doing so in a binary format and would impair
Services' responsiveness, and because I see XML as a data interchange
format rather than a data storage format and believe that the two should be
handled separately.  However, the former issue may well be moot for smaller
networks, and the latter is a matter of taste; in addition, the current XML
import and export modules lack the flexibility of the database system, as
discussed at the top of <a href="8.html#s4-1">section 8-4-1</a>, so I leave
this issue here for consideration.</li>

<li class="spaced">Currently, Services records all log messages to a single
log file, in a format intended for human perusal rather than machine
processing.  This could be improved with an "event log" system and logging
modules, whereby a common log function is called with some sort of event
identifier and event data, and the log module(s) then perform appropriate
actions; this would allow, for example, the creation of a log file with
all nickname-related events stored in a format easily parsable by other
programs, or the creation of an online "log channel" to which nickname and
channel operations are sent.</li>

<li class="spaced">ChanServ currently requires a password for founder-level
access to registered channels.  However, since those privileges are also
granted to the founder him/herself upon nickname identification, channel
passwords could be considered optional; deliberately not setting a password
on a channel would thus prevent the channel from being taken over by
password theft.  However, the password also serves as an extra measure to
prevent accidental dropping of channels (the <tt>DROP</tt> command requires
password authentication), so an alternate method would have to be
considered if channel passwords were made optional.</li>

<li class="spaced">As mentioned in <a href="7.html#s4-1-4">section
7-4-1-4</a>, it may be desirable to include "successor" channels in a
user's owned-channel count.  This would alleviate the potential for a
channel with a successor to nonetheless disappear on deletion of the
founder's nickname (because the successor owned too many channels at that
particular time).</li>

<li class="spaced">Services has used a level-based access system since its
inception, in which channel users are assigned a single numeric access
level; this level then determines what privileges (if any) the user is
allowed on the channel.  While more flexible than a simple system like the
XOP command set, the use of numbers can prove confusing and difficult to
understand, and there is no way to selectively grant higher-level
privileges without also granting lower-level ones.  A system such as the
"role" system used in PTlink Services 3.x, in which privileges are
individually granted to users, could help solve these problems.</li>

<li class="spaced">The use of binary bitfields to represent channel modes
allows for efficient processing; however, it causes problems when changing
from one protocol to another, because channels' mode lock data is stored
using those same bitfields.  One way around this is to simply export and
re-import the data using XML (which is probably a good idea in any case, to
compensate for things like different processing of nicknames and channel
names).  An alternative approach would be to store the modes as strings, at
the cost of additional processing and storage requirements.  Still another
approach might define a common set of mode bits among all protocols,
allowing other protocols' modes to be interpreted properly; in essence, the
set of modes defined in the core mode handling would be the union of all
those defined in the standard protocol modules, rather than the
intersection.  However, this would require wider data fields to handle the
necessity of giving every mode its own unique bit, and would leave
third-party protocol modules without a way to express their own custom
modes.  The wisdom of including protocol-specific data in the Services core
is also questionable.</li>

<li class="spaced">The OperServ privilege system is currently very coarse.
It essentially provides only three distinct classes: no privileges,
Services operator, and Services administrator.  (The super-user class is
identical to the administrator class except for the ability to modify the
Services administrator list and to bypass the NSSecureAdmins security
restrictions.)  Moreover, the privileges granted to Services operators are
very limited, while those granted to Services administrators are extremely
powerful, leaving no "middle ground".  At least one user of Services has
noted that the inability to view user information, for example to resolve
disputes between users, without also granting full administrator privileges
is problematic.  Services would benefit from a review of these privilege
classes; for example, it might be wise to require super-user privileges for
dangerous commands such as <tt>JUPE</tt> and <tt>SHUTDOWN</tt>, which would
then allow the administrator class to be used for tasks such as viewing
user information.</li>

<li class="spaced">Related to the above, it might be useful to allow
OperServ privileges and related commands (such as NickServ and ChanServ
<tt>FORBID</tt> or <tt>INFO ALL</tt>) to be assigned to different classes
based on configuration settings.  For example, one network might decide to
allow Services operators to use information retrieval commands (currently
limited to Services administrators), while another might choose to let all
IRC operators use the OperServ <tt>AKILL</tt> command.  Note that allowing
this sort of configuration will require dynamically-generated help messages
(since the required privilege class may change at runtime), in addition to
new OperServ privilege-checking functions similar to
<tt>is_services_oper()</tt> and <tt>is_services_admin()</tt>.</li>

<li class="spaced">Configuration directives have been added somewhat
haphazardly over the course of Services' development, and could probably
use a review and overhaul.  In particular, there are several "negative
options", including <tt>NoBouncyModes</tt>, <tt>NoSplitRecovery</tt>, and
<tt>NoAdminPasswordCheck</tt>, which were added as negatives to avoid
changing Services' behavior in the middle of a release series.  These have
the unintuitive effect that <i>enabling</i> the option <i>disables</i> a
particular behavior; ideally, such options should be written as positives
(<i>e.g.,</i> <tt>BouncyModeCheck</tt> or <tt>SplitRecovery</tt>) and
enabled in the default configuration file.</li>

<li class="spaced" id="s1-gmake">As described in
<a href="10.html#s3-2">section 10-3-2</a>, the module compilation process
makes use of several time-consuming tricks to simplify the individual
modules' Makefiles.  However, version 3.81 of GNU <tt>make</tt> introduced
the special target <tt>.SECONDEXPANSION</tt>, which causes dependency lists
in subsequent rules to be expanded twice; for example, a rule
<div class="code">%.so: %.o $$(OBJECTS-$$@)</div>
(note the escaped <tt>$</tt> characters, to prevent expansion on the first
pass) would do what it looks like&mdash;supply a dependency list using a
variable name derived from the target module name.  Use of this feature
could substantially simplify the <tt>modules/Makerules</tt> file, at the
expense of incompatibility with versions 3.79 and 3.80 of GNU
<tt>make</tt>.</li>

<h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="s2-2">11-2-2. ChanServ issues</h4>

<ul>
<li class="spaced">Better integration of channel keys with ChanServ; for

<p class="backlink"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>


<h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="s2-7">11-2-7. Rejected suggestions</h4>

<p>In addition to the above, the author has explicitly rejected a few
feature suggestions as unnecessary or inappropriate for inclusion in
Services; however, they are recorded here for the consideration of future
developers.</p>

<ul>
<li class="spaced"><b>Automatic opping/voicing/etc. of users on channel
	access list changes.</b>  For example, automatically setting
	<tt>+o</tt> on a user added to the access list with auto-op
	privileges.  While this is certainly not a useless feature, access
	list changes are typically one-time events, and do not warrant the
	added complexity of including such a feature; the user can be
	manually opped or voiced just as easily.</li>
<li class="spaced"><b>Allow identification to multiple nicknames.</b>
	This can result in ambiguities when handling channel access levels.
	For example, suppose a user has identified to two nicknames,
	GoodNick and BadNick.  If on a certain channel, GoodNick has an
	access level of 50 but BadNick has an access level of -10, what
	access level should the user be granted?  The answer varies with
	the particular channel and user, and rather than attempting to
	invent a system of options and rules to handle every possible
	circumstance, Services simply disallows identification to multiple
	nicknames entirely.  (Services will remember whether a user has
	identified for a nickname if the user temporarily switches to
	another nickname.)</li>
<li class="spaced"><b>A channel option or configuration file setting to
	make ChanServ join channels, or a BotServ pseudoclient to do the
	same thing.</b>  This is one of the most common feature requests,
	but it has consistently been rejected as incompatible with the
	design of Services as a streamlined network tool rather than a
	users' toy, and also because standard bots can provide equivalent
	functionality much more flexibly than a single Services
	pseudoclient could.</li>
</ul>
