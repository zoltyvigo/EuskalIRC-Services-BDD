<h3>1-1. Introduction</h3>

<p>IRC Services (also called just "Services" for short) is a system of
services to be used with Internet Relay Chat networks.  Services provides
for definitive nickname and channel ownership, as well as the ability to
send messages ("memos") to offline users, and gives IRC operators
considerably more control over the network.

<p>In particular, Services provides the following features to an IRC
network:

<p><ul>
<li><b>Nickname management.</b>  Services allows users to "register"
nicknames, and will prevent users other than the registrant from using
them.  Services also maintains information about each registered nickname,
including the last time the nick's owner was online as well as a URL and
E-mail address that can be set by the user.

<li><b>Channel management.</b>  Like nicknames, Services allows users to
register channels as well.  A channel's owner can give privileges to other
users of the channel, such as auto-opping or the ability to set various
channel options, or conversely deny other users the ability to obtain
channel operator privileges or even enter the channel altogether.  Services
will remember the topic on the channel even after the last user leaves, and
can automatically set modes on the channel whenever a user joins it.

<li><b>Messages to offline users.</b>  Probably every IRC user has gone
through the experience of waiting and waiting for someone to come online in
order to pass a message along or ask a question.  Services alleviates this
with a "memo" system, allowing users to leave messages for other users even
if the recipient is not online at the time; the recipient will be notified
of the memo the next time they log on.

<li><b>Centralized network control.</b>  Services includes features which
allow IRC operators greater control over the IRC network through a single
point, and also defines multiple privilege levels for IRC operators with
respect to Services itself.  For example, IRC operators with sufficient
privileges can use Services to set modes on any channel; it is also
possible to ban users or groups of users from connecting to the network
entirely, and such bans ("autokills" in Services terminology) will remain
active even if a server, or Services itself, splits from the network.
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, each of these sets of features can be configured or
disabled to match individual networks' policies.

<h3>1-2. Overview of Services clients</h3>

<p>Each of the major feature groups mentioned in <a href="#1">section
1-1</a> above is controlled through a Services <i>client</i>, a nickname
associated with that particular set of features.  (These are often called
"pseudoclients", since they are not true clients, like IRC programs used by
humans, but conveniences to simplify access to Services' features.)  These
clients, as well as others which handle smaller areas of network control,
are briefly described below; a more detailed discussion of each feature is
presented in <a href=3.html>section 3</a>, while complete information on
each of the commands used to control each client can be found in
<a href=4.html>section 4</a>.

<p><b>NickServ</b> handles registration and maintenance of nicknames.  Its
primary functions include:
<p>
<ul><li>registration and de-registration (dropping) of nicknames;
    <li>verification of nickname users, including password authentication,
	and removal (either automatically or upon request) of unauthorized
	users;
    <li>creation and deletion of nickname aliases (links), which allow a
	single user to own and switch between multiple nicknames which
	share settings;
    <li>control of nickname options, including security level (whether to
	require a password or simply check the user's username and
	hostname), associated URL and E-mail address, and what information
	to show or not show to other users;
    <li>recording of nickname usage information, including the nickname's
	last used time and the username and hostname of the nickname's last
	user; and
    <li>expiration of nicknames that have not been used in a certain period
	of time.</ul>

<p>Services has the ability to send messages to users in multiple
languages; a user who has registered their nickname can select from any of
the supported languages (English, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian,
Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish).  A default language can also be
configured for users who have not registered their nicknames or have not
selected a specific language.

<p>Furthermore, NickServ has the ability to verify E-mail addresses
associated with nicknames, by sending an "authentication code" to the
E-mail address and not allowing the owner any privileges associated with
the nickname until the owner sends that authentication code back to
NickServ.  This feature can help maintain accountability of users for their
actions on IRC by requiring a valid E-mail address at which the user of a
nickname can be contacted if problems arise.

<p><b>ChanServ</b> is to channels what NickServ is to nicknames; it handles
registration and maintenance of channels on the IRC network.  Its functions
in large part mirror those of NickServ, and include:
<p>
<ul><li>registration and dropping of channels (a user who registers a
	channel is known as the channel's <i>founder</i>);
    <li>verification of channel users, through either direct password
	authentication or NickServ verification;
    <li>control of channel access and autokick lists (see below);
    <li>monitoring and adjustment of channel modes, including automatically
	giving channel-operator or voice privileges or "inviting"
	authorized users into invite-only channels;
    <li>control of channel options, such as preventing users from changing
	the topic or controlling the strictness with which channel modes
	and privileges are enforced, and setting a URL or E-mail address
	for the channel;
    <li>recording of channel usage information, including the last time a
	verified user was in the channel; and
    <li>expiration of channels that have not been used in a certain period
	of time.
</ul>

<p>One major difference between nicknames and channels is the <i>access
list</i>.  While nicknames may have an "access list" that lists addresses
which NickServ will recognize as "allowed to use the nickname"&mdash;a
feature that has little value if passwords are used as the primary means of
verification&mdash;channel access lists play a much greater role, in that
they control which users (nicknames) have what degree of access to
(privileges in) the channel.  The founder of a channel will always have
full access to the channel, but the founder can, via the access list,
designate other users who will receive a certain subset of channel
privileges.  For example, the founder might give privileges to some users
to automatically receive channel operator (<tt>+o</tt>) status when they
enter the channel; those users might then, in turn, designate other users
to automatically receive voice (<tt>+v</tt>) status if the channel is
moderated.  Certain levels of access also allow users to use privileged
ChanServ features, such as management of the "autokick list", explained
below, or commands which remove channel bans on a user or invite the user
into a channel.

<p>Conversely, the <i>autokick list</i> (often referred to as the "AKICK
list", from the name of the command&mdash;<tt>AKICK</tt>&mdash;which
controls it) specifies users which are not to be allowed access to the
channel at all.  If a user joins a channel whose autokick list they are
listed on, ChanServ will kick them out of the channel and set a channel ban
which prevents them from entering again.  Since a malicious user could
easily enter using an unregistered nickname, channel founders (or other
privileged users) can enter username/hostname masks as well as nicknames in
the autokick list.

<p>As channels are complex beasts, ChanServ features many options which
control how the channel is managed; for example, ChanServ can be set to
disallow any changes to the channel topic (if a user changes the topic,
ChanServ will cancel the change by restoring the previous topic), or to
prevent any users not explicitly entered in the access list from using the
channel.  ChanServ can also enforce a certain set of modes on a channel;
for example, a channel which wants to stay hidden from casual users could
use ChanServ to ensure that the <tt>+s</tt> (secret) mode is always set on
the channel.

<p>If the founder of a channel loses his nickname, whether by explicitly
dropping it or by letting it expire, the channel will be dropped as well.
If this should happen by accident, it can be difficult to restore all of
the channel settings.  To help avoid this problem, ChanServ allows channel
founders to designate a <i>successor</i> for the channel.  If the founder's
nickname should ever be dropped or expire, then ChanServ will give the
channel to the successor&mdash;making them the new founder of the
channel&mdash;rather than dropping the channel.

<p><b>MemoServ</b> handles storage and notification of <i>memos</i>, short
messages between IRC users.  Memos can be thought of as an intermediate
stage between realtime chat and E-mail; they are sent and read in the same
way as ordinary chatting, but can be sent even if the recipient is not
online at the time, and the recipient can read the memos at his or her
leisure.  Memos are particularly useful for short messages for which it
would not be worth the time to start up an E-mail client and type out a
complete message, or for cases where the nickname of the recipient is known
but the recipient's E-mail address is not (or the recipient does not have
an E-mail address at all).

<p>MemoServ's four main functions are <i>sending</i> memos, <i>listing</i>
memos which have been received, <i>reading</i> memos, and <i>deleting</i>
memos after they have been read.  Users can also set memo options, which
include whether to notify them of new memos when they log on and whether
they should be able to receive memos at all, and can have memos
automatically forwarded to an authenticated E-mail address.

<p>In addition to memos between users, memos can also be sent to channels;
such memos will be sent to all users with sufficient privileges on the
channel.  This type of memo can be used, for example, to inform channel
operators about a problem user, or as a way for users to ask questions
about the channel.

<p><b>OperServ</b> provides access to the "network control" functionality
of Services.  Available only to IRC operators, OperServ allows:
<p>
<ul><li>broadcasts of messages to the entire network (global notices), as
	well as recording of news messages to be sent to users when they
	connect to the network;
    <li>control of modes in any channel, as well as the ability to kick any
	user from any channel;
    <li>banning certain users from the entire network (autokill list and
	S-lines, described below);
    <li>limiting the number of users which can connect from a single IP
	address, useful for preventing "cloning" (sessions), as well as
	making exceptions to those limits;
    <li>disconnecting all users from a given IP address;
    <li>preventing certain servers from connecting to the network
	("juping");
    <li>setting global Services options; and
    <li>restarting or shutting down Services itself.
</ul>

<p>Many of these functions can, if misused, have disastrous effects for the
entire network; thus, OperServ implements a privilege system to limit which
IRC operators can use which functions.  Four different privilege levels are
defined: normal IRC operator, Services operator, Services administrator,
and Services super-user (also known as "Services root", from the Unix
tradition of using the username "root" for the system super-user).  Normal
IRC operators can use very few of the functions above, while the Services
super-user has absolute control over Services and the IRC network.

<p>Of particular note are the <i>autokill list</i> and <i>S-line</i>
features, which are to the network as autokick lists are to channels; users
in these lists will be prohibited from connecting to any server on the
network, and will be disconnected immediately if they do connect.  The
difference between the two is what they prohibit; the autokill list
prohibits certain combinations of username and hostname, much like autokick
lists do, while S-lines, named after the commands used by a certain IRC
server to implement them, prohibit nicknames, "real names", or IP addresses
(IP address checking is only available with a few IRC servers).

<p>OperServ also includes a separate client, by default called
<b>Global</b>, which is used to send global (network-wide) notices and news
messages to users.  Many networks rename this client to the same name as
their network; the name of the client (as well as all other Services
clients) can be changed by editing the configuration file, as described in
<a href="2.html#4">section 2-4</a>.

<p><b>StatServ</b> is an additional client which monitors and keeps basic
statistical information regarding network usage.  It can be useful to
check, for example, which servers are getting the most use, or whether
certain servers have a tendency to split from the network frequently.

<p><b>In addition</b> to the clients above, Services also has a built-in
HTTP (web) server, which allows access to Services information (such as
registered nickname and channel information and network statistics) without
having to connect to the IRC network.  See <a href="3.html#6">section
3-6</a> for more information about the HTTP server.
