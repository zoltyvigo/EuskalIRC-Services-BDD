<h2 align=center>Upgrading from version 4.5 and earlier</h2>

<a name=4.5-1></a>
<h3 align=center>1. Executable and configuration files</h3>

<p>In previous versions of Services, the main executable file (program
file) was called "<tt>services</tt>"; in version 5.0 it has been renamed to
"<tt>ircservices</tt>" to match the package name.  Once you are satisfied
that you don't need the old <tt>services</tt> executable file, you should
delete it (<tt>make install</tt> will leave it alone).

<p>Also, previous versions of Services (since 4.1.0) used a file called
"<tt>services.conf</tt>" to control various aspects of the behavior of
Services.  Services 5.0 also uses such a file, but it has been renamed to
"<tt>ircservices.conf</tt>" and its format has changed from previous
versions.  In particular, many of the options from previous versions are
now module options, and must be placed in a separate file called
"<tt>modules.conf</tt>".  Please see the manual, and the
<tt>example-ircservices.conf</tt> and <tt>example-modules.conf</tt> files
in the data directory, for details.

<p align=center><hr width="50%">

<h3 align=center>2. Running the <tt>configure</tt> script</h3>

<p>The <tt>configure</tt> script has been redesigned to require as little
input as possible; many of the options that previously required user input
during the configuration process have been moved to the
<tt>ircservices.conf</tt> file, and the script can now be completely
automated if you provide the <tt>-prefix</tt> option or both of the
<tt>-bindest</tt> and <tt>-datdest</tt> options to specify the pathnames
for installation.  Run <tt>configure</tt> with the <tt>-help</tt> option
for details on available command-line options.

<p>The <tt>configure</tt> script also now accepts all options in the GNU
long-option (two leading hyphens) style, so if you are used to the GNU
autoconf-style <tt>configure</tt>, you can now type <tt>./configure
--prefix=/usr</tt> (for example) to get the same effect with Services.

<h3 align=center>3. <tt>listnicks</tt> and <tt>listchans</tt></h3>

<p>Earlier versions of Services provided two additional programs,
"<tt>listnicks</tt>" and "<tt>listchans</tt>", to show nickname and
channel data from the command line.  These programs have been removed in
version 5.0 in favor of the new HTTP interface; the <tt>httpd/dbaccess</tt>
module provides the same functionality and much, much more.  (It is still
possible to retrieve data from the command line as well, using the
<tt>-export</tt> option; see <a href="5.html#1">section 5-1</a> for
details.)

<p align=center><hr width="50%">

<a name=4.5-4></a>
<h3 align=center>4. Encrypted passwords</h3>

<p>Unlike previous versions of Services, encryption is no longer an
"on/off" setting; instead, encryption is enabled by specifying an
encryption module in <tt>ircservices.conf</tt>.  See the manual
(<a href="3.html#7">section 3-7</a>) for details.

<p>If you are upgrading from version 4.4.x or earlier, and you use
MD5-encrypted passwords, <b>your passwords will no longer work</b> due to a
bug in those versions of Services.  Support is available in version 4.5 for
reading the broken passwords and allowing them to be reset; if you want to
give users a chance to change their passwords, you should first upgrade to
the most recent 4.5.x release, then when most or all of the users have
reset their passwords, upgrade to version 5.0.  For details, see the What's
New notes for version 4.5.

<p align=center><hr width="50%">

<a name=4.5-5></a>
<h3 align=center>5. Using the <tt>mail-auth</tt> module with existing
databases</h3>

<p>The <tt>mail-auth</tt> module is a new feature in version 5.0 which
allows E-mail addresses to be checked for validity.  When enabled, all new
nickname registrations and E-mail address changes will require the user to
verify that the address provided is valid, by entering an authentication
code mailed by Services to the address.  However, if you are upgrading from
an earlier version of Services, some users may already have entered invalid
E-mail addresses for their nicknames.

<p>To correct this situation, the command-line option
"<tt>-clear-nick-email</tt>" can be given (note that this option is only
valid if NickServ is enabled).  When this option is used, Services will
clear the E-mail address associated with all registered nicknames; all
users will then be required to enter their E-mail address again and verify
it with an authentication code before being allowed to identify for their
nicknames.

<p>If you intend to use the <tt>mail-auth</tt> module, it is recommended
that you use this option once when starting up Services 5.0 for the first
time.  This option only needs to be specified once to take effect.

<p align=center><hr width="50%">

<a name=4.5-6></a>
<h3 align=center>6. Nickname linking system changes</h3>

<p>The nickname linking system used in Services 5.0 is different from that
used in previous versions.  Rather than a multiple-level "tree" of linked
nicknames, nicknames are now organized into groups, and the <tt>LINK</tt>
and <tt>UNLINK</tt> commands add nicknames to or remove nicknames from this
group.  Functionally, there is little difference between this system and
using only one level of links in the previous system.  However, the
<tt>LINK</tt> and <tt>UNLINK</tt> commands work in the opposite direction
from version 4.x, taking a nickname parameter and adding or removing that
nickname (for example, "<tt>LINK OtherNick</tt>"), and nicknames to be
linked must be <i>unregistered</i> nicknames, which is also a change from
version 4.x; make sure your users are aware of these changes.

<p>Related to these changes, it is also important to note that the
behavior of the NickServ <tt>UNLINK</tt> and <tt>DROP</tt> commands has
changed with respect to de-registration of nicknames; in particular, <b>the
<tt>DROP</tt> command will now drop <i>all</i> linked nicknames!</b>  The
syntax for the <tt>DROP</tt> command has changed as well, requiring a
password to confirm the action, and the help message includes a warning,
but be aware that users may simply append their password to the command
without checking the help message, resulting in the unintended
de-registration of all of the user's nicks.  The <tt>UNLINK</tt> command
should be used to cancel single nicknames out of a group of links (a
nickname which is unlinked is deregistered as well, similar to
<tt>UNLINK</tt> followed by <tt>DROP</tt> in version 4.x).

<a name=4.5-7></a>
<h3 align=center>7. Memo expiration</h3>

<p>Version 5.0 of Services provides the ability to automatically delete
(expire) memos after a certain period of time.  Since this feature was not
present in previous versions and users may have important information saved
in memos, Services will not expire any memos which were sent before
upgrading to version 5.0; thus, it is safe to enable memo expiration without
having to warn users about loss of saved memos or taking other preventative
measures.  (However, it would be prudent to inform users that any future
memos will expire after a certain period of time, if you choose to enable
memo expiration.)

<p align=center><hr width="50%">

<a name=4.5-8></a>
<h3 align=center>8. Channel access levels</h3>

<p>Channel access levels have been rescaled in this version of Services to
make better use of the available range of values; instead of a range of
-9999 through 9999 where only values -2 through 10 are used, the range has
been reduced to -999 through 999, and default levels now range from -100 to
100 (all defaults have been increased by a factor of 10, with the exception
of <tt>AUTODEOP</tt> and <tt>NOJOIN</tt>, which are no longer changeable in
version 5.0 but are fixed internally at -1 and -100 respectively).  Level
values from version 4.x databases will be properly converted to use the new
range, so that all users will still have the same privileges as they did in
previous versions.  However, be aware that in some cases involving two
users with levels outside the range -50 through 50 in version 4.x, if the
levels are different but close (<i>e.g.</i> 1001 and 1002), then the users
will have the same access level in version 5.0.  The exact conversion
function is stepwise linear, as follows (negative levels are converted to
the negative of the conversion of the absolute value of the level):

<div align=center><table border=0>
<tr><th colspan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Old&nbsp;level&nbsp;(<i>o</i>)&nbsp;
    <th colspan=3>&nbsp;New&nbsp;level&nbsp;(<i>n</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <th>Conversion function
<tr><td align=right>0<td>. . .<td>25
    <td align=right>0<td>. . .<td>250
    <td><i>n</i> = 10<i>o</i>
<tr><td align=right>25<td>. . .<td>50
    <td align=right>250<td>. . .<td>300
    <td><i>n</i> = 2<i>o</i> + 200
<tr><td align=right>50<td>. . .<td>100
    <td align=right>300<td>. . .<td>320
    <td><i>n</i> = 2<i>o</i>/5 + 280
<tr><td align=right>100<td>. . .<td>1000
    <td align=right>320<td>. . .<td>500
    <td><i>n</i> = <i>o</i>/5 + 300
<tr><td align=right>1000<td>. . .<td>2000
    <td align=right>500<td>. . .<td>600
    <td><i>n</i> = <i>o</i>/10 + 400
<tr><td align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;2000<td>. . .<td>9999&nbsp;
    <td align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;600<td>. . .<td>999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <td><i>n</i> = <i>o</i>/20 + 500
</table></div>

<h2 align=center>Upgrading from version 5.0</h2>

<a name=5.0-1></a>
<h3 align=center>1. Switching to the new database format</h3>

<p>A new, more robust database file format has been developed for version
5.1 which is incompatible with the format used in earlier versions.  To
switch your databases to this format, ensure that the
<tt>misc/xml-export</tt> and <tt>misc/xml-import</tt> modules are loaded by
your <tt>ircservices.conf</tt>, and:
<ol>
<li>Shut down Services.
<li>Export your databases to an XML file using the command:
    <tt>ircservices&nbsp;-export=<i>database.xml</i></tt> (any filename can
    be used).
<li>Edit your <tt>ircservices.conf</tt> file and change the line reading
    <br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LoadModule&nbsp;database/version4</tt>
    <br>to
    <br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LoadModule&nbsp;database/<b>standard</b></tt>
    <br>Also enable the <tt>misc/xml-import</tt> module if it is commented
    out.
<li>Import the XML data from step 2 into the new database format using the
    command: <tt>ircservices&nbsp;-import=<i>database.xml</i></tt>
<li>Start up Services.
</ol>

<p>Note that switching to the new database format is not required; you can
continue to use your 5.0 databases by leaving the <tt>LoadModule
database/version4</tt> configuration line alone.  However, the new database
format allows you to recover more data even if the database files get
corrupted, so its use is recommended.  (It is also possible to switch back
to the old format from the new one in a similar manner, though all
5.1-specific data will be lost if the databases are used in an older
version of Services.)


<p align=center><hr width="50%">

<a name=5.0-2></a>
<h3 align=center>2. Channel memos</h3>

<p>Version 5.1 includes a redesigned channel memo system which distributes
channel memos to users of the channel (based on the channel access list)
rather than storing the memos with the channel.  As a result of this
change, all stored channel memos will be deleted when starting up version
5.1.  Users should be instructed to save any needed information before the
upgrade.

<p align=center><hr width="50%">

<a name=5.0-3></a>
<h3 align=center>3. Encryption handling</h3>

<p>Version 5.1 allows passwords encrypted with different ciphers (or not
encrypted at all) to coexist in the same database, by keeping track of
what cipher was used to encrypt the password; this allows for enabling or
disabling encryption, or changing the encryption type used, without
concerns of old passwords becoming unusable.

<p>However, since this ability was not present in version 5.0 and earlier,
Services has no way to know what encryption type was used in databases from
those versions, and simply defaults to the cipher given in the
<a href="a.html#EncryptionType"><tt>EncryptionType</tt></a> directive in
<tt>ircservices.conf</tt> for all passwords.  Therefore, if you continue to
use the <tt>database/version4</tt> database module in version 5.1, you must
ensure that <tt>EncryptionType</tt> is set correctly when you first load
the data; once you have saved the databases using version 5.1, such as with
the OperServ <tt>UPDATE</tt> or <tt>SHUTDOWN</tt> commands, you can change
<tt>EncryptionType</tt> freely.

<p>This also applies, of course, to converting databases from 5.0 to the
new <tt>database/standard</tt> module format; be certain that you do not
change <tt>EncryptionType</tt> until after you have exported the databases
to an XML file.

<p align=center><hr width="50%">

<a name=5.0-4></a>
<h3 align=center>4. NickServ/ChanServ <tt>SENDPASS</tt></h3>

<p>The NickServ and ChanServ <tt>SENDPASS</tt> commands have been removed
in favor of the new NickServ <tt>REAUTH</tt> command, and the corresponding
modules (<tt>nickserv/sendpass</tt> and <tt>chanserv/sendpass</tt>) have
been deleted.  Make certain to remove these modules from your
<tt>ircservices.conf</tt> file before starting Services 5.1.

<p align=center><hr width="50%">

<a name=5.0-5></a>
<h3 align=center>5. NickServ <tt>SET</tt> and <tt>UNSET</tt></h3>

<p>Services administrators should be aware that the NickServ <tt>SET</tt>
and <tt>UNSET</tt> commands now require a "<tt>!</tt>" before the nickname;
for example, instead of
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/msg NickServ SET nick NOEXPIRE ON</tt>
<br>type
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/msg NickServ SET <b>!nick</b> NOEXPIRE ON</tt>
<br>This is to avoid ambiguity where the nickname is the same as an option
name.
