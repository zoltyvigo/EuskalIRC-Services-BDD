<h3>5-1. Exporting Services databases in XML format</h3>

<p>In order to facilitate processing of the Services databases by other
programs, Services provides the ability to export the databases in XML
format.  This is accomplished through the <tt>misc/xml-export</tt> module
and, optionally, the <a href="3.html#6">HTTP server</a> built into
Services.

<p>The <tt>misc/xml-export</tt> module adds an extra command-line option,
<tt>-export</tt>, to Services.  Since the command line is parsed before
Services connects to the network, the module must be specified in your
<tt>ircservices.conf</tt> file to enable this option.  The option has the
format "<tt>-export</tt>" or "<tt>-export=<i>filename</i></tt>", where
<tt><i>filename</i></tt> is the name of the file to write the XML data to;
if it does not begin with a slash, it is taken to be relative to the
Services data directory (the directory containing the database and log
files).  If <tt><i>filename</i></tt> is not given or is a single hyphen
("<tt>-</tt>"), the data will be printed on standard output.  When the
export completes, Services will terminate without connecting to the IRC
network.  This action can be performed while another copy of Services is
running, but the output will not include changes made online since the
last time the databases were saved to disk.  (It is also possible for the
running copy of Services to report a "data directory locked" error if it
tries to save the databases while the export operation is in progress.
This is harmless; you can force the databases to be written after the
export completes by using the OperServ
<a href="4.html#oper.update"><tt>UPDATE</tt></a> command, but do not use
the <tt>FORCE</tt> option while the export is still running as this may
result in corrupted database files.)

<p>Additionally, if the <tt>misc/xml-export</tt> module is loaded into
Services, the HTTP database access module (<tt>httpd/dbaccess</tt>) will
display an "XML database download" link.  Clicking on the link will display
the XML data in your browser, which you can then save (for Firefox and
Internet Explorer, select "Save as..." or "Save page as..." from the
browser's File menu).  Alternatively, you can download the link directly
without displaying it in your browser; in Firefox, hold the Alt key while
clicking on the link, and in Internet Explorer, right-click on the link and
select "Save target as..." from the pop-up menu.

<p>The format of the exported XML data is described in
<a href=b.html>Appendix B</a>.

<p><b>Notes:</b> Services will not respond to any network activity while you
are downloading the database.  If you have a large database, this can make
Services appear to "freeze" with respect to the IRC network, and it may
even get disconnected from the network in extreme cases.  Additionally, be
aware that the data may change after you have downloaded it; if you want to
avoid this, for example when exporting data to move it to another machine
or network, use the command-line option <tt>-export</tt> (after shutting
Services down) rather than the HTTP server interface.

<p><b>Note to Internet Explorer users:</b>  Some versions of Internet
Explorer have a bug which can prevent the XML data from being displayed or
downloaded properly.  If you have this problem, use another browser, or add
the following key to your registry using the Registry Editor
(<tt>regedit</tt>), as described in Microsoft Knowledge Base article
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q239750">Q239750</a>
<font size=-1>[<tt>support.microsoft.com</tt>]</font>:

Improper use of the Registry Editor can cause your system to malfunction,

system files as described in the Knowledge Base article linked to above
if you are using Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT 4.0.

<h3>5-2. Importing (merging) data from an XML file</h3>

<p>Just as it can export data in XML format, Services can also read in XML
data and import (merge) it into its databases.  Importing is handled by the
<tt>misc/xml-import</tt> module.  Unlike exporting, however, importing
cannot be done via the HTTP server; it is always done through the command
line.  For this reason, the <tt>misc/xml-import</tt> module must be loaded
at startup if it is to be used, rather than via an OperServ
<a href="4.html#oper.rehash"><tt>REHASH</tt></a> or a <tt>SIGHUP</tt>
signal.

<p>To import a set of data stored in XML format into Services, start
Services with the command-line option "<tt>-import=<i>filename</i></tt>",
where <tt><i>filename</i></tt> is the name of the file containing the data;
if the filename does not begin with a slash, it is taken to be relative to
the Services data directory.  Services will parse the data file, and if no
errors are found, the data will be merged into Services' databases and the
program will terminate.  If problems are found, they will be printed on
standard output and the databases will not be modified.

<p>Normally, if nickname or channel "collisions" occur&mdash;that is, if a
nickname or channel in the input data is already registered in Services'
databases&mdash;Services will skip over that nickname group or channel,
respectively.  (For nicknames, the entire nickname group is skipped to
prevent cases where, for example, a user's secondary nick is available but
the primary nick is registered to someone else.)  This behavior can be
modified by the
<a href="a.html#misc/xml-import.OnNicknameCollision"><tt>OnNicknameCollision</tt></a> and
<a href="a.html#misc/xml-import.OnChannelCollision"><tt>OnChannelCollision</tt></a>
options in <tt>modules.conf</tt>.  Additionally, Services can be made to
output a list of all data imported by setting the
<a href="a.html#misc/xml-import.VerboseImport"><tt>VerboseImport</tt></a>
option (which is set in the example <tt>modules.conf</tt> provided with
Services).

<p>Note that the maximum user count and OperServ
<a href="4.html#oper.su"><tt>SU</tt></a> password will not be imported;
news items will not be imported unless the
<a href="a.html#misc/xml-import.ImportNews"><tt>ImportNews</tt></a> option
(in <tt>modules.conf</tt>) is set.  Also, any autokills, autokill
exclusions, session limit exceptions, or S-lines which collide with those
in the database will be automatically skipped.

<h3>5-3. Converting data from other Services-like programs</h3>

<a name=3-1></a>
<h4>5-3-1. Using the <tt>convert-db</tt> program</h4>

<p>For users of other Services-like programs who want to switch to IRC
Services, a program called <tt>convert-db</tt> is supplied to convert
databases used by such programs into XML data files, which can then be
imported into Services as described in <a href="#2">section 5-2</a> above.
This program is installed into the Services data directory
(<tt>/var/opt/ircservices</tt> for binary distributions,
<tt>/usr/local/lib/ircservices</tt> by default for source distributions).

<p>In its simplest form, <tt>convert-db</tt> takes the pathname of the
directory containing the database files to convert on the command line,
and writes the converted XML data to standard output.  A typical invocation
might look like this:
<blockquote>
	<tt>convert-db /usr/local/lib/<i>someprogram</i> &gt; <i>someprogram</i>.xml</tt>
</blockquote>
<tt>convert-db</tt> will look at the files in the directory given and
attempt to determine automatically what program created them; if this
succeeds, it will proceed to read in the database files and convert them to
XML.  If <tt>convert-db</tt> cannot determine what program created the
files, you can tell it explicitly by adding a <tt>+<i>program-name</i></tt>
option in front of the path name (see the full syntax description below for
valid values for <tt><i>program-name</i></tt>).

<p>Note that not all features of all programs are supported by Services,
and some settings may be lost when you import data.  See
<a href="#3-2">section 5-3-2</a> below for notes on particular programs,
and <a href="#2">section 5-2</a> for information on importing the converted
data into Services.

<p>The full syntax for <tt>convert-db</tt> is as follows:
<blockquote>
	<tt>convert-db [-v] [+<i>program-name</i>] [<i>options</i></tt> . . . <tt>] <i>pathname</i></tt>
</blockquote>
The options and parameters are:
<ul>
<li><tt>-v</tt>: Display progress information as the data is converted.
<li><tt>+<i>program-name</i></tt>: Explicitly indicates what program was
	used to create the data files.  A list of possible
	<tt><i>program-name</i></tt> values is given in table 5-1 below.
	<tt><i>program-name</i></tt> values are not case sensitive.
<li><tt><i>options</i></tt>: Additional options specific to each type of
	data file controlling details of the data conversion; see below.
<li><tt><i>pathname</i></tt>: Specifies the pathname of the directory
	containing the database files.
</ul>

<p>Note that the following programs and versions are <i>not</i> supported,
because they do not store data in standard disk files:
<ul>
<li>Anope 1.7.11 and later, when using MySQL databases (a standard file
	format is still available as of version 1.7.19)
<li>PTlink Services 3.0.0 and later
</ul>

<p>Additional options are available for the following data file types:

<p><b><tt>anope</tt></b>
<ul>
<li><tt>-ircd=<i>protocol</i></tt>: Selects the protocol to use for
	interpreting channel modes.  By default, only basic channel modes
	(<tt>+i</tt>, <tt>+k</tt>, <tt>+l</tt>, <tt>+m</tt>, <tt>+n</tt>,
	<tt>+p</tt>, <tt>+s</tt>, and <tt>+t</tt>) will be imported for
	channel mode locks; to import extended modes provided by particular
	specify the corresponding protocol from the following list (for
	Anope 1.7.6 and later, use the same name as in the
	<tt>IRCDModule</tt> configuration directive):
	<ul>
		<li><tt>bahamut</tt> for Bahamut
		<li><tt>dreamforge</tt> for Dreamforge
		<li><tt>hybrid</tt> for IRCD-Hybrid
		<li><tt>ptlink</tt> for PTlink IRCd
		<li><tt>ultimate2</tt> for UltimateIRCD 2.x
		<li><tt>ultimate3</tt> for UltimateIRCD 3.x
		<li><tt>unreal</tt> for UnrealIRCd
		<li><tt>viagra</tt> for Viagra IRCd
	</ul>
<li><tt>-encryption=<i>type</i></tt>: Selects the encryption type for
	databases from Anope 1.7.18 and later.  These versions of Anope do
	not record the encryption type used with passwords stored in the
	databases; in order to use such passwords, you must specify the
	proper encryption type with this option:
	<ul>
		<li><tt>none</tt>: No encryption (<tt>enc_none</tt> module)
		<li><tt>md5</tt>: MD5 encryption (<tt>enc_md5</tt>,
			<tt>enc_old</tt> modules)
		<li><tt>sha1</tt>: SHA-1 encryption (<tt>enc_sha1</tt>
			module)&mdash;<i>not supported</i> by Services
			(passwords will be converted correctly, but will
			not be usable without a third-party module)
	</ul>
	<b>Note:</b> If you use this option and your database contains a
	mix of encrypted and unencrypted passwords from Anope 1.7.17 or
	earlier, some of the passwords will not work.
</ul>

<p><b><tt>cygnus</tt></b>
<ul>
<li><tt>-tzfile=<i>filename</i></tt>: Specifies an alternative time zone
	file to use when loading nickname time zone data.  <tt>convert-db</tt>
	defaults to the data from the <tt>cygnus.zone</tt> file distributed
	with Cygnus 0.2.0; if you have modified this file or created your
	own time zone list, you will need to use this option to get nickname
	time zones converted correctly.
<li><tt>-no-timezones</tt>: Causes all nickname time zone settings to be
	reset to default (the time zone Services runs in).
<li><tt>-reset-memo-limits</tt>: Causes all nickname memo limits to be reset
	to default; see the notes on Cygnus database conversion.
</ul>

<p><b><tt>hybserv</tt></b>
<ul>
<li><tt>-crypt</tt>: Indicates that all passwords are encrypted.  Without
	this option, all passwords are assumed to be in plain text.
</ul>

<a name=3-2></a>
<h4>5-3-2. Notes on converting databases from particular programs</h4>

<p>Note that this is not a comprehensive list of differences; only the
major differences and types of data that cannot be converted are listed.

<p><b>All programs</b>
<ul>
<li>The setter and reason for a forbidden nickname or channel will not be
	imported.
<li>Channel privilege level settings (the equivalent of the ChanServ
	<tt>LEVELS</tt> command), on programs that support them, will not
	be imported; all channels' privilege levels will be reset to the
	default values.
<li>Services does not record the setter and last used time for channel
	access entries; this data will be lost on conversion for programs
	that do record it.
<li>Services does not support "bots" or a "BotServ", and all such data will
	be lost on conversion.
</ul>

<p><b>Anope</b>
<ul>
<li>For version 1.7.11 and later, databases must be stored using the
	standard ("FFF") format; MySQL databases are not supported.
<li>Anope versions through 1.7.17 contain the MD5 encryption bug present
	in versions of IRC Services before 4.5; as a result, encrypted
	passwords will not work by default.  As a workaround, you can
	enable the
	<a href="a.html#encryption/md5.EnableAnopeWorkaround"><tt>EnableAnopeWorkaround</tt></a>
	configuration option for the <tt>encryption/md5</tt> module in
	<tt>modules.conf</tt>, but be aware that this may reduce the
	security of your passwords.  There are also rare cases in which
	passwords may be truncated in the databases; if you encounter such
	a case, the password will have to be changed manually by a Services
	administrator.</li>
<li>Services does not store the following information; it will be lost when
	the databases are converted:
    <ul>
	<li>ICQ number for nicknames
	<li>Last used time for channel access entries
    </ul>
<li>The NickServ <tt>SET AUTOOP OFF</tt> option present in Anope 1.7.15 and
	later is converted to <tt>SET NOOP ON</tt>; however, the behavior
	in of <tt>NOOP</tt> in Services is slightly different, as it only
	prevents the nickname from being added to channel access lists (the
	nickname will still be auto-opped if it already has that privilege
	in a channel).
<li>Services does not allow multiple users to have Services super-user
	privileges (except temporarily with the
	<a href="4.html#oper.su"><tt>SU</tt></a> command); all users with
	"root" privileges in Anope will be converted to Services
	administrators.
<li>Services does not distinguish between using the ChanServ <tt>OP</tt>,
	<tt>VOICE</tt>, and related commands on oneself or on other users;
	both operations use the same privilege level.
<li>Services does not support the ChanServ <tt>SECUREFOUNDER</tt>,
	<tt>SIGNKICK</tt>, or <tt>XOP</tt> settings.  (<tt>XOP</tt>-style
	commands can be enabled for all channels by loading the
	<tt>chanserv/access-xop</tt> module.)
<li>Nickname requests (nicknames which have been registered but not
	confirmed via E-mail) are discarded; users with pending nickname
	requests will need to re-register.
</ul>

<p><b>Auspice</b>
<ul>
<li>The NickServ <tt>NOOP</tt> option behaves slightly differently in
	Services: it prevents the nickname from being added to channel
	access lists, but the nickname will still be auto-opped if it
	already has that privilege in a channel.
<li>The ChanServ <tt>TIMEOP</tt> feature in version 2.6 and later is not
	supported.  Nicknames on a channel's <tt>TIMEOP</tt> list will not
	be added to the channel's access list for Services, and thus will
	have no privileges on the channel.
<li>Services does not support "root" and "master" privilege levels as in
	Auspice.  There can only be one root nickname, which is set in
	<tt>modules.conf</tt>; all root/master settings in the data files
	will be discarded.  (Admin/oper settings will be retained.)  Note
	that Services admins can perform any function (except modifying the
	admin list), including modifying Services settings and shutting
	down Services.
<li>NickServ <tt>AUTH</tt>, <tt>COMMENT</tt>, <tt>NOTE</tt>, <tt>LOCK</tt>,
	<tt>MARK</tt>, <tt>SET KILL HIGH</tt>, <tt>SETFLAG AUTOJOIN</tt>,
	and <tt>SETMLOCK</tt>, as well as ChanServ <tt>BADWORDS</tt>,
	<tt>FREEZE</tt>, and <tt>MARK</tt>, are not supported.  Nickname
	notes will be converted to non-expiring memos with the user
	themselves as the sender; other data will be lost.
<li>Services uses a different news system than Auspice; network and channel
	news items will not be converted.
<li>Aside from the above, Services does not store the following
	information; it will be lost when the databases are converted:
    <ul>
	<li>UIN, age, and gender for nicknames
	<li>Last <tt>GETPASS</tt> user and <tt>HOLD</tt> setter and reason
	    for channels
    </ul>
<li>E-mailing of log files is not supported.
</ul>

<p><b>Bolivia</b>
<ul>
<li>The NickServ <tt>NOOP</tt> option behaves slightly differently in
	Services: it prevents the nickname from being added to channel
	access lists, but the nickname will still be auto-opped if it
	already has that privilege in a channel.
<li>Limiting channels to privileged users (the <tt>LEVEL</tt> command) is
	not supported, and such restrictions will be discarded when
	converting the databases.  However, some IRC servers (such as
	Unreal) have channel modes allowing channels to be limited to IRC
	operators or administrators only, and Services allows those modes
	to be locked on with the <tt>SET MLOCK</tt> command.
<li>ChanServ <tt>FREEZE</tt> is not supported.
<li>ChanServ <tt>HOLD</tt> setter will be lost when converting.
<li>E-mailing of log files is not supported.
</ul>

<p><b>Cygnus</b>
<ul>
<li>Services does not store the UIN, real name, age, sex, or location for
	nicknames; this information will be lost when the databases are
	converted.
<li>Services does not send replies using <tt>PRIVMSG</tt>; the
	<tt>NOTICE</tt> and <tt>PRIVMSG</tt> nickname settings will be
	ignored.
<li>The following options/features are not supported:
	<ul>
	<li>NickServ <tt>NEVEROP</tt> and <tt>NOSUCCESSOR</tt>
	<li>ChanServ <tt>LIMITED</tt>
	<li>MemoServ <tt>RECEIPTS</tt>
	<li>RootServ <tt>MARK</tt>
	</ul>
<li>Nicknames designated as CSOPs will be converted to Services operators.
	Note that the privileges granted by IRC Services to Services
	operators are different from those granted by Cygnus to CSOPs.
<li>Nicknames will retain their memo limit settings in the converted data;
	however, they will not be affected by changes to the
	<a href="a.html#memoserv/main.MSMaxMemos"><tt>MSMaxMemos</tt></a>
	setting.  (Memo limits can be reset to the default, which follows
	the <tt>MSMaxMemos</tt> setting, with the <tt>-reset-memo-limits</tt>
	option.)
<li>If you have modified the time zone list used by Cygnus
	(<tt>cygnus.zone</tt>), nickname time zones will not be transferred
	correctly by default.  Use the <tt>-tzfile=</tt> option to ensure
	that time zones are loaded from your time zone file, or use the
	<tt>-no-timezones</tt> option to reset all time zone settings to
	default.
<li>Authentication for channels is not supported; authentication codes and
	"verify" information will be discarded.
<li>Channel access list entries in IRC Services must always be registered
	nicknames; <tt><i>user</i>@<i>host</i></tt> entries, and any
	entries not matching a registered nickname, will be deleted.
<li>While the channel topic-lock setting will be retained, the lock level
	(founder/SOP/AOP/HOP/VOP) will be reset to the IRC Services default
	(AOP).  If you use the <tt>LEVELS</tt> command (in the
	<tt>chanserv/access-levels</tt> submodule), you can change the
	level of the <tt>TOPIC</tt> command to set which users are
	allowed to change the topic.
<li>While not directly related to the databases, note that Services uses
	the <a href="4.html#nick.auth"><tt>AUTH</tt></a> command, not the
	<tt>REGISTER</tt> or <tt>SET EMAIL</tt> commands, to authenticate
	nicknames.
</ul>

<p><b>Daylight</b>
<ul>
<li>Services does not support the <tt>XMANAGEMENT</tt> channel setting.
</ul>

<p><b>Epona</b>
<ul>
<li>Epona contains the MD5 encryption bug present in versions of IRC
	Services before 4.5; as a result, encrypted passwords will not work
	by default.  As a workaround, you can enable the
	<a href="a.html#encryption/md5.EnableAnopeWorkaround"><tt>EnableAnopeWorkaround</tt></a>
	configuration option for the <tt>encryption/md5</tt> module in
	<tt>modules.conf</tt>, but be aware that this may reduce the
	security of your passwords.  There are also rare cases in which
	passwords may be truncated in the databases; if you encounter such
	a case, the password will have to be changed manually by a Services
	administrator.</li>
<li>Services does not store the following information; it will be lost when
	the databases are converted:
    <ul>
	<li>ICQ number for nicknames
	<li>Last used time for channel access entries
    </ul>
<li>Services does not distinguish between using the ChanServ <tt>OP</tt>,
	<tt>VOICE</tt>, and related commands on oneself or on other users.
<li>By default, only basic channel modes (<tt>+i</tt>, <tt>+k</tt>,
	<tt>+l</tt>, <tt>+m</tt>, <tt>+n</tt>, <tt>+p</tt>, <tt>+s</tt>,
	and <tt>+t</tt>) will be imported for channel mode locks.  To
	import extended modes provided by particular IRC servers, use one
	of the following command-line options:
	<ul>
		<li><tt>-ircd=bahamut</tt> for Bahamut
		<li><tt>-ircd=ultimate2</tt> for UltimateIRCD
		<li><tt>-ircd=unreal</tt> for UnrealIRCd
	</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>HybServ</b>
<ul>
<li>Services does not store GSM, phone, or ICQ number for nicknames; this
	information will be lost when the databases are converted.
<li>Services does not have the concept of "permanent passwords", as in
	HybServ 1.6.1+UniBG, and such passwords will be discarded on
	import.
<li>Services does not support the NickServ <tt>AUTOMASK</tt>, <tt>HIDE
	URL</tt>, <tt>NOREGISTER</tt>, or <tt>NOCHANOPS</tt> settings, or
	the ChanServ <tt>GUARD</tt> or <tt>VERBOSE</tt> settings.
<li>The NickServ <tt>NOOP</tt> option behaves slightly differently in
	Services: it prevents the nickname from being added to channel
	access lists, but the nickname will still be auto-opped if it
	already has that privilege in a channel.
<li>The NickServ <tt>HIDE ALL</tt> setting is treated as a combination of
	<tt>HIDE EMAIL</tt>, <tt>HIDE USERMASK</tt>, and <tt>HIDE QUIT</tt>.
	The nickname URL and options cannot be hidden.
<li>Temporary forbids are imported as permanent (Services does not support
	the notion of a "temporary" or "timed" forbid).
<li>"Forgotten" channels are not supported, and will not be imported.
<li>Services does not have a system of "operator modes" like HybServ, and
	no operator mode information will be imported.
<li>Statistics information (maximum number of users/channels/etc.) will not
	be imported.
<li>The founder of a channel will be removed from the channel's access list
	(founders always have full channel privileges and do not need to be
	added to the access list).
<li>Channel privilege levels will be reset to the Services defaults on
	import.  Channel access levels will also be modified to fit within
	the -999&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;999 range used by Services, as follows:
<p align=center><table border=1>
<tr><th>HybServ level<th>Services level
<tr><td align=center>-10000<td align=center>-999
<tr><td align=center>-9999&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;-10<td align=center>-999&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;-1

<p><b>WARNING:</b> As a result of differences in the default level settings
between HybServ and Services, some users will have access to commands which
they did not previously have access to.  In particular, the <tt>ACCESS</tt>
command is available to all users with access level 40 (HybServ level 8) or
above, and the <tt>CLEAR</tt> command is available to all users with
access level 100 (HybServ level 15) or above.  Conversely, the
<tt>INVITE</tt> command is available only to users with access level 50
(HybServ level 10) or above; auto-voice users cannot use it.
</ul>

<p><b>IRCS</b>
<ul>
<li>By default, IRCS supports channels with names longer than 63 characters
	(including the leading "#").  Services does not support these by
	default, and such channels will not be imported.
<li>Channel autoop/autovoice cannot be set for individual nicknames.  All
	nicks with appropriate access will be opped even if ChanServ
	<tt>SET AUTOOP OFF</tt> was used for the nick.
<li>The numeric access level for <tt>SOP</tt> is different from that used
	in Services, so some access levels will be altered to match the
	default <tt>SOP</tt> level in Services.  (Channel privileges will
	remain unchanged.)
<li>The "senior", "junior", and "helper" OperServ access levels do not
	exist in Services.  Users on the "senior" list will be moved to the
	Services admin list; users on other lists will be moved to the
	Services operator list.  <b>WARNING:</b> As a result of the above,
	users on the "senior" list will be given access to the
	<tt>JUPE</tt> and <tt>LISTIGNORE</tt> commands.
</ul>

<p><b>Magick I 1.4</b>
<ul>
<li>Services does not send replies using <tt>PRIVMSG</tt>; the
	<tt>NI_PRIVMSG</tt> nickname setting will be ignored.
<li>Services does not have a "channel news" system like Magick, and all
	channel news items will be discarded.
</ul>

<p><b>PTlink</b>
<ul>
<li>PTlink supports several encryption methods; of these, the "JP2" method
	is not supported by Services, and any passwords encrypted with this
	method will be reset to the respective nick or channel name.
<li>Services does not store the following information; it will be lost when
	the databases are converted:
    <ul>
	<li>ICQ number, location, birthdate, time of last identify, and
	    authentication code (2.22.0 and later) for nicknames
        <li>maximum number of users and time of maximum for channels
    </ul>
<li>An apparent bug in PTlink causes the successor field of some channels
	to be corrupted; this will result in warnings when loading the
	channel database.
<li>What PTlink refers to as "SXlines" are known as "SGlines" in Services;
	SXline database records (in versions of PTlink that support it)
	will be converted to SGline records.
</ul>

<p><b>SirvNET</b>
<ul>
<li>The NickServ <tt>NOOP</tt> option behaves slightly differently in
	Services: it prevents the nickname from being added to channel
	access lists, but the nickname will still be auto-opped if it
	already has that privilege in a channel.
<li>Limiting channels to priviliged users (the <tt>LEVEL</tt> command) is
	not supported, and such restrictions will be discarded when
	converting the databases.  However, some IRC servers (such as
	Unreal) have channel modes allowing channels to be limited to IRC
	operators or administrators only, and Services allows those modes
	to be locked on with the <tt>SET MLOCK</tt> command.
<li>NickServ <tt>AUTH</tt> and ChanServ <tt>FREEZE</tt> are not supported.
<li>ChanServ <tt>HOLD</tt> setter and reason will be lost when converting.
<li>E-mailing of log files is not supported.
</ul>

<p><b>trircd</b>
<ul>
<li><tt>SET EXCEPTION</tt>, <tt>SET INVITES</tt>, <tt>HIDE OPTIONS</tt>,
	and <tt>HIDE DESC</tt> channel settings are not supported.
</ul>

<p><b>Wrecked 1.2.0</b>
<ul>
<li>Services does not send replies using <tt>PRIVMSG</tt>; the
	<tt>NI_PRIVMSG</tt> nickname setting will be ignored.
<li>The <tt>VOPALL</tt> channel setting is not supported.
</ul>
