# Enter the protocol name here, then uncomment the appropriate directives.

Module protocol/(insert protocol name here)

    # NetworkDomain domain  [RECOMMENDED]
    #     Protocols: bahamut, dalnet, dreamforge, monkey, ptlink, rfc1459,
    #                trircd, ts8, undernet-p9
    #
    #     Specifies the common domain, if any, shared by all servers on
    #     your IRC network; this is required for global notices to function
    #     properly.  Make sure you do not include a "." before the domain
    #     name.  If you do not specify this, some or all users may not
    #     receive global notices.

    #NetworkDomain   "example.net"

    # ServerNumeric <numeric>  [RECOMMENDED]
    #     Protocols: unreal
    #
    #     Makes Services send a numeric to the remote server on connect.
    #     This must be a value between 1 and 254, and must not be in use by
    #     any other IRC server on the network.  If you do not want to use a
    #     numeric for Services, comment the directive out.

    #ServerNumeric   1

    # SetServerTimes [<time>]  [RECOMMENDED]
    #     Protocols: unreal
    #
    #     Causes Services to synchronize all servers' internal clocks with
    #     its own; this can help avoid potential problems with users
    #     improperly gaining chanops, particularly during netsplits.  If a
    #     time parameter is given, Services will repeatedly synchronize the
    #     servers clocks at that interval, otherwise synchronization will
    #     only be performed at startup.

    #SetServerTimes
    #SetServerTimes  12h

    # CSSetChannelTime  [OPTIONAL]
    #     Protocols: bahamut, monkey, trircd, unreal
    #
    #     When enabled, causes Services to set the "creation time" (the
    #     time at which the first user joined the channel) of a registered
    #     channel to the time at which the channel was registered.  This
    #     can help prevent spurious mode changes and "op hacking" when a
    #     split server reconnects to the network.  When using Unreal,
    #     however, the first user to join the channel when it is empty gets
    #     set -o and +o in quick succession due to limitations of the IRC
    #     server; if this bothers you, do not enable this option.  Also, some
    #     servers (such as Bahamut) generate server notices each time a
    #     channel's timestamp is changed, which can be safely ignored.

    # AutokillReason <reason>  [REQUIRED]
    #     The reason to use when sending out KILLs for autokills and with

    AutokillReason  "You are banned from this network"
    #AutokillReason  "Autokilled: %s"

    # AutokillExpiry <time>  [RECOMMENDED]

    #     Sets the default expiry time for autokills added by an AKILLCHAN
    #     command.

    AkillChanExpiry 7d

    # OperMaxExpiry <time>  [OPTIONAL]
    #     Sets the maximum expiry time usable by Services operators.  If
    #     not defined, Services operators can set any expiry time, just as
    #     Services administrators can.  If this is set to a value lower
    #     than AutokillExpiry or AkillChanExpiry, autokills entered without
    #     an expiry time will use this setting instead of the relevant
    #     default.

    #OperMaxExpiry   7d

    # EnableExclude  [OPTIONAL]
    #     Causes autokill exclusions to be usable.  If not given, the
    #     EXCLUDE command will be unavailable, and any autokill
    #     exclusions previously added will be ignored.
    #
    #     NOTICE: On IRC servers without autokill exclusion functionality
    #     (such as that in trircd version 5), this will cause autokills to
    #     not be sent to the server; instead, Services will issue a KILL
    #     for each user that matches an autokill and does not match any
    #     autokill exclusions.  This is necessary to allow Services to
    #     apply exclusions to users before they are disconnected.

    #EnableExclude

    # ExcludeReason <reason>  [REQUIRED if EnableExclude set]
    #     The reason to use when sending out EXCLUDE commands on servers

    # ImmediatelySendAutokill  [OPTIONAL]
    #     Causes OperServ to inform all servers of a new autokill the
    #     moment it is added, rather than waiting for someone to match it
    #     first.  (Note that autokill exclusions are always sent to the
    #     server immediately; this is to avoid an autokill being triggered
    #     by a non-excluded match before the exclusion has been sent,
    #     resulting in the excluded users being autokilled as well.)

    #ImmediatelySendAutokill

    # WallOSAkill  [OPTIONAL]

    #     The message that will be NOTICE'd to a user just before they are
    #     removed from the network because their host's session limit has
    #     been exceeded.  It may be used to give a slightly more

    #
    #     The recovery grace period is the length of time a nick must exist

    #     suspended for longer than "NSExpire" will be expired (dropped)

    #
    #     When a hostname is given, as in the second example below,

    #     hostname lookup can take time--especially if there is no DNS
    #     server on the local network--and is susceptible to network or
    #     DNS server outages, so IP addresses or "*" should be used
    #     whenever possible.
    #
    #     Note that many systems restrict low port numbers to the system

    #     allowed or denied), the string "*" (which means all addresses),
    #     or the special format "<IP-address>/<mask>", where <mask> is an
    #     integer from 1 to 31 giving the number of bits in the subnet
    #     address, which indicates that the entire subnet of addressess
    #     specified should be allowed or denied; for example,
    #     "192.168.1.64/26" represents the range of addresses from
    #     192.168.1.64 to 192.168.1.127.
    #
    #     Examples:
    #        AllowHost /debug 127.0.0.1   # Allow all requests from localhost
    #                                     #   to the debug page
    #        AllowHost / 192.168.0.0/24   # Allow any host in the 192.168.0.*
    #                                     #   network access to the entire
    #                                     #   server
    #        DenyHost / shell.example.org # Deny connections from any address
    #                                     #   associated with shell.example.org
    #
    #     Multiple AllowHost or DenyHost directives for the same path may
    #     be used to specify multiple addresses to allow or deny.  Each
    #     condition will be checked in the order they are listed here, and
    #     the first matching one will be used.  For example, these lines:
    #        AllowHost / 192.168.0.1
    #        DenyHost  / 192.168.0.0/24
    #     deny access to all hosts in the 192.168.0.* network _except_
    #     192.168.0.1.  However, the reverse:
    #        DenyHost  / 192.168.0.0/24
    #        AllowHost / 192.168.0.1
    #     simply blocks all hosts in the 192.168.0.* network, since the
    #     first rule matches 192.168.0.1 and the second is never checked.
    #
    #     Access to the entire server can be allowed or denied by using the
    #     path "/", which matches every URL (since all URLs begin with a
    #     slash).  Such a rule should always be included at the end of the
    #     rule list to explicitly indicate what should be done with
    #     requests that do not match any other rule; the behavior of the
    #     module for requests without a matching rule is undefined.  For
    #     example:
    #        AllowHost / *
    #     or:
    #        DenyHost / *
    #
    #     WARNING: Hostnames are resolved only once at startup; any changes
    #              in a host's IP address will not be seen by Services.
    #
    #     Note: These directives are listed as "optional" only because the
    #           module will still load even if no directives are listed;
    #           however, unless AllowHost/DenyHost directives are given,
    #           the module will not have any effect.

################################ Password authorization module

Module httpd/auth-password

    # AuthName <name>  [REQUIRED]
    #     Specifies the name to be used by the user's browser when asking
    #     for a password (as in "Enter username and password for <name>:").

    AuthName        "IRC Services"

    # Protect <path> <user>:<pass>  [OPTIONAL]
    #     Sets the URLs (paths) which will be protected by password
    #     authorization, and the username and password for each path.  The
    #     username and password can be different for each path.  The path
    #     given will match any URL beginning with that string, as with the
    #     auth-ip module.
    #
    #     Examples:
    #         Protect	/debug	"debug:debug"
    #         Protect	/~	"nickuser:nickpass"
    #
    #     Note: This directive is listed as "optional" only because the
    #           module will still load even if no directives are listed;
    #           however, unless Protect directives are given, the module
    #           will not have any effect.  Use a path of "/" to apply
    #           password protection to the entire server.

################################ Database access module

Module httpd/dbaccess

# NOTICE: This module allows complete access to all Services data;
#         be certain to protect it from unauthorized access using
#         authorization modules or other means.

    # Prefix <path>  [REQUIRED]
    #     Sets the URL (path) at which database access will be accessible.
    #     If this does not end with a slash, one will be appended
    #     automatically.  Access is provided using the following directory
    #     tree:
    #
    #         <path>/                   Main menu
    #         <path>/operserv/          OperServ data and menu
    #         <path>/operserv/akill/    Autokill list
    #         <path>/operserv/news/     News item list
    #         <path>/operserv/sessions/ Session and exception lists
    #         <path>/operserv/sline/    S-line lists
    #         <path>/nickserv/          Nickname list and information

    #         <path>/xml-export/        XML-format database download
    #
    #     Categories for which the relevant module is not loaded will not
    #     be accessible.
    #
    #     WARNING: These functions, particularly the XML export function,
    #              can cause Services to stop for a significant period of
    #              time while they are processed!
    #
    #     This is commented out by default; make sure you implement proper
    #     access protection (see above) before uncommenting it.

################################ Debug page module

Module httpd/debug

    # DebugURL <path>  [REQUIRED]
    #     Sets the URL (path) at which the debug page will be accessible.
    #     This must begin with a slash.

    DebugURL        "/debug"

################################ Nick/channel redirect module

Module httpd/redirect

    # NicknamePrefix <path>  [OPTIONAL]
    #     Sets the URL (path) at which nickname redirects will be
    #     accessible; all characters after this prefix, up to the next
    #     slash, will be taken as the nickname.  This must begin with a
    #     slash.  The default value, "/~", emulates the traditional home
    #     page URL of "http://www.example.net/~username/".  If you use a
    #     directory name instead, it must end with a slash, for example:
    #     "/nickname/".  See also ChannelPrefix, below.
    #
    #     If not set, nickname redirects will not be done.

    NicknamePrefix  "/~"

    # ChannelPrefix <path>  [OPTIONAL]
    #     Sets the URL (path) at which channel redirects will be
    #     accessible; all characters after this prefix, up to the next
    #     slash, will be taken as the channel name (without the leading
    #     "#", which cannot be used in URLs).  The path must begin with
    #     a slash.  The default value, "/channel/", gives URLs like
    #     "http://services.example.net/channels/channelname/" for channel
    #     "#channelname".
    #
    #     If not set, channel redirects will not be done.
    #
    #     Note: If a URL could be interpreted as both a nickname URL and a
    #           channel URL, the nickname will take precedence, even if it
    #           is not registered or does not have a URL associated with it.

    ChannelPrefix   "/channel/"

################################ Top page module

Module httpd/top-page

    # Filename <path> [<content-type>]  [OPTIONAL]
    #     Sets the name of a file to be delivered as the server's top page.
    #     If this does not begin with a slash, then it is taken as relative
    #     to the Services data directory.  The second parameter specifies
    #     the MIME content type of the file; if not given, it defaults to
    #     text/html.

    #Filename        "Top Page.txt" text/plain
    #Filename        /var/www/html/ircservices/top-page.html

    # Redirect <URL>  [OPTIONAL]
    #     Sets a URL to be provided as a redirect to a client accessing the
    #     top page.  This must be a full URL, beginning with "http://" (or
    #     some other protocol specifier).  If both Filename and Redirect
    #     are given, Redirect takes precedence.

################################ XML import settings

Module misc/xml-import

    # OnNicknameCollision <action>  [OPTIONAL]
    #     Specifies the action to be taken when a nickname in the data to
    #     import is already registered.  The string must be one of either
    #     "skipgroup" (skip over the nickname group containing the nickname
    #     in the imported data), "skipnick" (skip only the colliding
    #     nickname), "overwrite" (drop the existing nickname), or "abort"
    #     (do not import any data).  Note that when "abort" is selected,
    #     the entire XML input is still checked for errors, but Services
    #     will abort before actually merging any data.
    #
    #     When using "overwrite", if a nickname group has only one nickname
    #     and that nickname is overwritten, the nickname group will be
    #     dropped as well.  As a consequence, any channels owned by such a
    #     nickname will be dropped (or shifted to their successors) as
    #     well.  All nicknames and channels overwritten or dropped in this
    #     manner will be displayed on standard error.
    #
    #     If not specified, defaults to "skipgroup".

    #     "skip" (skip over the channel in the imported data), "overwrite"
    #     (drop the existing channel), or "abort" (do not import any data).
    #     Note that when "abort" is selected, the entire XML input is still
